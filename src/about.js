                <p className='fade'>Hi! My name is Varun Saxena and I will be a second year student 
                    pursuing a bachelor's degree in  computer science at the 
                    University of Virginia in the Fall. I was initially interested in STEM and computer science 
                    at the start of middle school, where I joined the 
                    Centreville Robotics organization. I was quickly shown the ropes
                     of the robotics organization, which included designing and 
                     building robots, but it also included coding them to move 
                     autonomously and through user input. I was a member and later team 
                     leader and board member of Centreville Robotics for six years, and I gained a lot of 
                     experience through building and coding numerous robots for competitions, as well as teaching new members engineering 
                     and coding, and earning many rewards and qualifying for the state and national level of FTC and FRC. While doing this, Centreville robotics held 
                     numerous STEM fairs at our high school, where we could teach kids about STEM and programming. My brother and I also started 
                     a programming club at our old elementary school Centre Ridge, where we taught numerous fourth through sixth graders about Scratch and Java. I was also fortunate enough to 
                     join the Nth Degree private robotics team, where I also assisted in the java framework for PID/Feedforward Control, Motion Profiling, 
                     & OpenCV/TensorFlow Image Processing. I also assisted in the outreach program of Nth Degree, including participating in FIRST Global, where our team 
                     connected to a group of kids in the Cayman Islands and assisted in them making their first ever functional robot.
            </p>
            <p className='fade'>I continued to kindle and grow my interest in computer science when I arrived at UVA. 
                I did this by taking numerous computer science undergraduate classes, helping me learn more about the field, 
                such as data structures, 
                computer systems, and discrete mathematics. 
            </p>
            <p className='fade'>I want to continue expanding my knowledge on computer 
                science and one day contribute in the full-stack development of web applications
                 and apps as well as contribute to machine learning. I want to contribute to extensive and complex applications to be utilized by many 
                 and help numerous people. If youâ€™re looking for someone who is strong at problem 
                 solving, communicating, teaching, and learning, please reach out!
